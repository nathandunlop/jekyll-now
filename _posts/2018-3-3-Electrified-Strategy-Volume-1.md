Welcome to the first volume of my electric vehicles newsletter, I will capture the most interesting articles and reports from the industry over the past couple of weeks. As always, views and opinions are my own. Thanks

📈[Nope, Cobalt’s Not a Problem:](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/11/nope-cobalts-not-problem-ev-revolution-will-march/) A great rebuttal to the continual noise that a Cobalt shortage will stop the transition to EVs. Insights from BNEF suggest that as demand signals continue to increase, the market will both scale from being an adjacent secondary metal to a standalone resource, and be tempered by a shift to more resource efficient technology configurations.

🔋 [Demand Shocks in the Lithium Industry:](https://www.ft.com/content/609adb06-0a61-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09) The FT covers the financial dealings in the Lithium industry post the Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) deal with Chilean regulators to up production. Analysts are worried any big bets have to be based on EV uptake forecasts which will dramatically change the lithium price.

🚕 [Autonomous Taxis, Who Will Reap the Revenues:](https://ark-invest.com/research/autonomous-taxi-revenues) Analysis from ARK Investment Management projects the future value chain of transport will be largely owned by platform providers and vehicle owner/operators. It will be interesting to think through how platform providers squeeze the value pools of owner operators or move down the chain to the customer themselves.

🚘 [Waymo Zooms Ahead in California Autonomous Vehicle Testing:](https://about.bnef.com/blog/waymo-zooms-ahead-california-autonomous-vehicle-testing/) Great insight from BNEF showing how far ahead Alphabet’s autonomous vehicles arm Waymo is ahead of any competitors. Waymo through November 2017 accounted for 85% of all autonomous miles driven on public roads in California. While GM is ramping up its testing, it’s clear that Waymo is very far ahead at this stage and believes it will achieve a huge first mover, winner takes most prize.

⛽️ [BP Energy Outlook 2018:](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2018.pdf) An interesting look at the future of energy. BP has fairly bullish EV adoption rates, suggesting electrification it is now a core focus as they truly understand the value at risk from diminishing fuel usage. BNEF looks into the details and provides their reasoning as to why their EV adoption rates are substantially higher than BP over the longer term [here](https://about.bnef.com/blog/bps-energy-outlook-and-the-rising-consensus-on-ev-adoption/).
